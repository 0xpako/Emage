### About

Emage is an easily-approachable web framework built on top of React, Next.js, and Vercel, designed for rendering static sites with optimized images and edge rendering. It combines the power of React for interactive UIs, Next.js for server-side rendering, and Vercel's edge computing for faster content delivery. Emage automates image compression, resizing, and lazy loading, enhancing website performance, while Vercel's global edge network ensures low latency. With Emage, developers can create visually stunning, high-performing static websites that offer an exceptional user experience.
